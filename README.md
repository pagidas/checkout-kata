# checkout kata

Implement the code for a supermarket checkout that calculates the total price of a 
number of items.

In a normal supermarket, items are identified by ‘stock keeping units’ or ‘SKUs’. In
our store, we will use individual letters of the alphabet, A, B, C etc, as the SKUs. Our
goods are priced individually. In addition, some items have promotions of any of the
following types:

- Multipriced: buy n of them and which will cost you y. For example, item A might
cost 50 pence individually but this week we have a special offer where you can
buy 3 As for £1.30.
- Buy n get 1 free.
- Meal deal: buy different items together and get a special price. For instance,
items D and E might cost 150 and 200 pence each individually but this week we
have a special offer where you can buy one of each for just £3.

This week’s prices are the following:

| Item | Unit Price (in pence) | Special Price       |
|------|:---------------------:|:--------------------|
| A    |          50           |                     |
| B    |          60           | 2 for £1            |
| C    |          25           | Buy 3, get one free |
| D    |          150          | Buy D and E for £3  |
| E    |          200          | Buy D and E for £3  |

Our checkout accepts items in any order so if we scan a B, then an A, then another 
B, we will recognise the two B’s and apply the special promotion of 2 for £1.

Extra points: Because the pricing changes frequently we will need to be able to pass
in a set of pricing rules each time we start handling a checkout transaction.
